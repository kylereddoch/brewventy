Welcome to **Brewventy** - where great coffee meets great web development! ☕

Just like brewing the perfect cup of coffee, creating a beautiful website requires the right ingredients, proper technique, and attention to detail.

## ☕ What Makes Brewventy Special?

Brewventy isn't just another Eleventy theme - it's a carefully crafted blend of:

- **Beautiful Design**: Using the beloved Catppuccin color palette
- **Coffee Metaphors**: Mocha (dark) and Latte (light) themes that actually make sense
- **Performance**: Lightning-fast loading, like your morning espresso shot
- **Accessibility**: Everyone can enjoy our coffee shop experience

## 🚀 Quick Brew Setup

Getting started is as easy as ordering your favorite drink:

### 1. Clone Your Coffee Shop
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eleventy-brewventy-theme.git
cd eleventy-brewventy-theme
```

### 2. Install the Ingredients
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start Brewing
```bash
npm start
```

Your site will be brewing at `http://localhost:8080` ☕

### 4. Serve the Perfect Cup
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🎨 Choosing Your Coffee Flavor

Brewventy comes with two carefully crafted flavors:

### ☕ Mocha (Dark Theme)
Perfect for:
- Late-night coding sessions
- Focused reading
- Cozy atmosphere
- Reducing eye strain

### 🥛 Latte (Light Theme)
Ideal for:
- Morning productivity
- Professional presentations  
- High contrast reading
- Clean, minimalist look

To set your default flavor, edit `src/_data/site.json`:

```json
{
  "theme": "mocha"  // or "latte" for light theme
}
```
